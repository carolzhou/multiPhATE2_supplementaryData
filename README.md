# multiPhATE2_supplementaryData
Supplementary data in support of multiPhATE2 publication.
This sample multiPhATE2 output data set has been abridged for storage on github. Only representative intermediate outputs from blast, hmm, and profile searches are provided in their respective subdirectories. Only the Eb_P2/ results directory contains complete output from the Gene Calling and PhATE subsystems; some of the data from the Eb_WPhi/ and Ec_pro483/ subdirectories have been removed.
